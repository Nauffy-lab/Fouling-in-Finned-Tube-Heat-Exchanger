# Fouling-in-Finned-Tube-Heat-Exchanger
As part of a Chemical Lab Project under Prof. Abhijit Majumdar at the Chemical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, as part of a group of three, I conducted an experimental analysis to evaluate the performance of longitudinal finned tube heat exchangers under fouling conditions. Our study revealed a 32% reduction in efficiency due to fouling, highlighting its significant impact on heat exchanger performance. To quantify this effect, we calculated fouling factors and heat transfer rates using Microsoft Excel, ensuring accurate analysis and visualization. Based on our findings, we provided actionable insights into the consequences of fouling and emphasized the importance of regular maintenance to optimize heat exchanger efficiency and longevity.
